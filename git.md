title: Git Notes

Introduction
============

These notes constitute a brief summary of the `git` version control tool.
They are incorrect, and it is your task to find and correct the mistakes.

You are judged, however, not on finding all the mistakes, but on your use of version control
in doing the work of fixing them!

Finding the mistakes will be a useful revision, though.

Activating git
==============

To turn on the version control system, use:

``` bash
cd my_work_folder
git init
```

Tell git about a new file
=========================

```
vim my_file #Â Edit file
git add my_file
```

Include changes in a file into the next commit 
==============================================

```
git add my_file
```

This includes the changes to that file in a list of changes
currently scheduled to be included in the next commit.

Include all scheduled changes into a commit
===========================================

```
git commit -m "Journal entry"
```

Store all scheduled changes in a new commit
===========================================

```
git commit --update
```

Include all changes *and* commit them
=====================================

```
git commit -am "Journal entry"
```

View list of recent commits
===========================

```
git log
```

Transmit chunks to remote repository
====================================

```
git push
```

Fetch chunks from remote repository
===================================

```
git pull
```
